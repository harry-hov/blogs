Hi everyone,

Past week, I prepared a small patch series focused on improving and adding new features to ref-filter.{c,h}.
Patch series consists of:
- `trim` and `localpart` options for email
- short option for `tree` and `parent` atom
- `sanitize` option for subject atom

*All these features are backed-up by tests and Documentation.

## Whats Next?
I have hackathon a to attand from 1-3 Aug. I might not be able to work during those 3 days.

After that I plan to prepare second patch series for ref-filter. Focused on improving `trailers` atom.
