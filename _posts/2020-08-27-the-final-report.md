Hi everyone,

Finally, the time has come, to sum up all my work so far into a single blog post. Without wasting any time, let's talk about the project.

## PROJECT

In short, my project is to simplify the codebase by removing duplicate logic. The task is to re-use ref-filter.{c,h}'s logic in pretty.{c,h}.

## WHEN I MET GIT?

I was planning to contribute in git since Aug'19. And I made my first contribution to git via [gitgitgadget](https://gitgitgadget.github.io/) in Oct'19. At that time I was mentored by dscho(aka Johannes). I continued to contribute even since then and managed to get some of my merged.
