title: "Week 1: The Ten Questions: All or Nothing!"

Hi everyone,

This week I'm mostly worried about my performance. I wasn't able to come up with the proper approach to unifying  `ref-filter` and `pretty` formatting logic. 

I approached my mentors, they said its ok to take time. Christian helped me in understanding Olga's work in a better way. He put some up some questions for me. Those questions are really helpful. 
Regardless of the project, those questions will help anyone who wants to understand someone's work.
So, it's a good idea to mention those in this blog [Hope he does not mind]

[*Dont* Hold your breath] Here are those:

- What was the goal of each patch?
- Which approach did she took to achieve the goal?
- What were the goals of the patch series?
- Which approach did she took to achieve the goals?
- What was the goal of her previous patch series?
- What was the general direction her patch series were going?
- Why did she took that direction?
- Are there ways to continue in the same direction?
- Are there ways to achieve similar goals?
- How were her goals similar and different from the goals in my proposal?
- Is it possible to use the same approach?



Whats next?

"A good approach often comes from studying things, from trials and
errors, and from discussions with other people" -  Christian

So, now I'm going to deep-diving into `pretty.c` and `ref-filter.c` formats.
Also, will adding support for atoms in `pretty.c`.

Summary: This week probably was unproductive, but it's full of learning.

bye... cya!
