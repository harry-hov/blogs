Hi everyone,

I'm Hariom and I was accepted for the Google Summer of Code 2020. This summer I'm going to work on ["Unify ref-filter formats with other --pretty formats"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4593212745842688). I'm pretty excited to work with my mentors *Christian Couder* & *Heba Waly* 

It's been a few days since GSoC's projects were announced. During this initial time I've been mainly working on three things:

1. Reading Olga's blogs and looking at her work(related to cat-file & ref-filter).
2. Trying to understand the formating logic behind pretty and ref-filter.
3. Playing around with pretty and ref-filter by making minor changes. (I think that's a great way to understand how things work)

While going through her blogs I found that extremely informative(step-by-step) debugging guide by Christian. I think its worth sharing again, So here is the link: [https://public-inbox.org/git/CAP8UFD3Bd4Af1XZ00VyuHnQs=MFrdUufKeePO1tyedWoReRjwQ@mail.gmail.com/](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAP8UFD3Bd4Af1XZ00VyuHnQs=MFrdUufKeePO1tyedWoReRjwQ@mail.gmail.com/)

I am not afraid of saying that I'm having a little difficulty in understanding the logic behind formatting options in pretty and ref-filter. I think I'm going to spend the next few days in understanding it well.

I also worked on a patch([https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.606.git.1587412477.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.606.git.1587412477.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)) about a month ago. But unfortunately, I forgot to add Jonathan in Cc. So it didn't move forward. My mentor Christian reviewed my patch and also mentioned Jonathan. I also received a few helpful reviews from others. Well, I'm not leaving that patch behind and planning to work on it along with my summer project. Just to mention, my main focus would always be on my summer project.

I think that's it today. See you next week.
