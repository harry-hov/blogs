Hi everyone,

## Previous Week

- Fix things from old reviews.
- Add new email formatting options in ref-filter.
- Fix `ae` and `ce` in pretty-lib.c
- Add `al` and `cl` in pretty-lib.c
- Worked on `signature` atom.

# What's Next

Will continue working on tasks that I committed for previous week and are still incomplete.
Apart from that, will work on adding `reflog` as an atom to ref-filter.c
